Through diplomatic channels the Japanese embassy has recently contacted us ('MURICA!) about a very serious matter that needs resolving ASAP. As Russia is ramping up its international presence on the international market becoming the source of many manufactured goods and natural minerals. While this strenghtens the Russian position on the world stage surpassing China as the chief manufacturer of cheap tat nobody needs or actually wants, they have been covertly exporting cartoons to both the east and the west. As you all may know, this however is a privilege bestowed on and only on the proud nation of Japan. The proud nation of Japan started their search for the source of both unsanctioned and cheaper cartoons they sent all the ninja's they could spare to Russia to find their source. To their surprise Russia has a large deposit deep underground which is being pumped up North of Georgia, which luck has it we have a friendly base nearby with a bunch of planes able to deal with this.

Our primary objective is to disrupt the Russian operation of extracting Hentai-grade Animé. This is done by destroying the pumps and storage of the Hentai-grade Animé. There is a network of SAM sites surrounding the area and there are interceptors on stand-by on the nearby air-bases and airfields.

Tasks by priority:
1) Destroy pumps near steerpoint named "TGTs"
2) Destroy tanks near steerpoint named "TGTs"

If there are slower aircrafts that have a calendar as a speed-gauge (A-10C) it is the task of faster aircrafts to ensure their security by dealing with incoming threats. This will be predominantly dealing with airborne threats, while a SEAD-strike might be helpful, it may not be needed. The site isn't in the threat-range of all the surrounding SAM-sites, but birds operating in the area should take note and not divert to much from the flight-plan or steerpoint 4.


Fastmovers have the following STPTs:
1) Fence In
2) Border
3) IP
4) TGTs
5) GTFO/EXFIL
6) Border
7) Fence Out
8) 127.0.0.1


A-10C:
- Follow the flight plan, stay below the mountain tops, but try to gain as much height as possible in order to preserve
- Between STPT 13-17 Stay Low (1000 & 1500) in order to avoid being detected by the IADS.
- Recommended to follow steerpoints, but going over the mountain-range at high-speeds is fine. As long as you keep low from STPT 14 and onwards.

Steerpoints marked as border mark the Russian and Georgian national border. Getting caught North of this means you are on your own.
