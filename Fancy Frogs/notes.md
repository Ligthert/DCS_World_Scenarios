Units:
Hawg1: A-10C
Springfield2: F-16C
Dodge3: F/A-18C

Execution:
Due to the element of surprise it is inadvisable to cross the border into Russian territory as individual flights, instead all flights should cross the border in short order.
1) Flights hold south of the Fence In steerpoint until all flights are present
2) HAWG1 crosses the border first (and announce this over tactical) followed by the other flights
3) All flights follow the flightplan
4) At steerpoint 3 Springfield2 deals with A2A threats; Dodge3 will deal with AA threats.
5) In case Dodge3 have exhausted their AA threats they will deal with A2A threats Springfield2 may have missed
5) When Hawg1 reaches startpoint 11 they will bomb while Springfield2 and deal with targets of opportunity
6) Once Hawg1 did their bombings all flights will RTB; Springfield2 will clean the way towards base, Dodge3 will cover the rear.

Details:
Hawg-1 (A-10C): Follow the steerpoints to Psebay (FJ48/FJ58 at STPT 11) and take out the 3 buildings marked in the briefing and if possible any other vehicles and infantry if you have the opportunity.
At steerpoint 2 fence in. From Steerpoint 2 to 9 stay low and in the canyon for you to avoid radar contact with any threats out there. Fly a bit higher between steerpoint 3 and 4 due to terrain elevation.
Once tasking is complete the steerpoints for RTB is up to the flight-lead. Follow the proven route back or b-line it to home (STPT-12).

Springfield2 and Dodge3 flights:
Your primary task is to keep the A-10C flights safe from both airborne threats and anti-air installations on the ground.
(Have one or two ships field anti-radiation missiles for any AA threats at steerpoint 3.)
Fence in when flying towards steerpoint 1 (Fence In) before flying into Russian airspace.
Proceed to steerpoint 2 (IP) and loiter at steerpoint 3 (Lab) dealing with AA threats and airborne threats in cooperation with the AWACS.
Do not drift to far away from steerpoint 3 due to air defences in the vicinity.
Steerpoint 4 is the location of bulls-eye.
Steerpoint 5 is homeplate

You will be facing off against:
- SU-27 CAP and QRF
- SA-10 and SA-19 air defences
