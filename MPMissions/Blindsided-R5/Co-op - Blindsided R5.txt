[Briefing room]
(See Blindsided-Situation-*.jpg) 
We have not received any word back from the eastern patrol, since they reported hearing heavy vehicles in the pass. We can only assume the worst.

Twenty minutes ago we received confirmation that insurgent forces are attempting a surprise attack on the Batumi aerodrome. Be advised we have received reports that the insurgents are able to mount a credible anti-air threat, furthermore there are indications they may have the support of unknown airforces.

US Specops are right now sending ahead a two man TACP unit, designation 'Ferret', to provide coordination for a counter attack on an insurgent outpost located due east. Before we can rid ourselves of the outpost though, we must succesfully defend Batumi from the insurgent forces closing in. Be aware that we are facing at least two groups heading in from the outpost.

Local defense forces are engaged with light enemy units as I speak. Your aircraft have been fueled and armed, there is no time to waste, scramble!


Aimed at: 
Pilots reasonably comfortable with combat tasks and start up, moderate difficulty level.
Pilots up for more challenge can enable higher difficulty at the beginning of the mission (Radio options, F10 Other).

Featuring: 
* Co-op and single player support. Note: Difficulty higher for single player.
* Plenty of scripted events with radio traffic and detailing. Fully voice acted!
* Combined operations of air to ground and air to air aircraft, all playing important but not interdependent roles (Set higher difficulty for best effect).
* Adapting mission design: Air to ground, air to air and combat search and rescue operations are each an optional component of the mission.
  All you need to do is fly the right aircraft and the mission commences.
* Dynamically generated randomized air to air threats for the entire duration of the mission. You can't be sure where the enemy air assets will strike from.
* Dynamically generated CSAR rescue operations for both stranded aircrews and vehicle crews.
* Up-to-date tasking can be requested even if a player enters the mission in the middle of it. No more guessing what state the mission is in.
* Choice of two difficulty levels.
* Some more aggressive, scripted AI behaviour.
* Some munitions restricted through the warehouse functionality for a proper challenge.
* On the move troop deployments.
* Airlifted JTAC available (but not necessary) for operations against the insurgent outpost.
* Optional AFAC available for the defense phase of the mission.
* Adapt to rapidly developing situations as you fight an enemy that fights back rather than passively waiting for you to attack.
* Be a part of a team where your actions truly matter to the outcome of the mission.

- A-10C slots changed to 4, two new SU-25A slots added.
- Improved tasking logic ported over from Two-Pin Hedgehog.
- Re-balanced insurgent air forces for added variety and challenge. Bandit missile launch behaviour now more randomized as well.

Revision 3 changes:
- Added 3x SU-27 with parallel CAP mission alongside CAS: Protect the airspace from enemy fighters and Batumi from air strikes.
- If any SU-27 takes off, this will enable the CAP portion of the mission with randomized air threats.
- Hostile air forces will be (temporarily) recalled after 10 minutes if no blue CAP is in the air.
- Made aircraft unlimited, munitions still are limited (Better suited for open servers).
- Marked any possible troop deployments along the road with a single Ural-375 to aid in spotting. 
- Slightly improved Batumi air defense for some protection from insurgent CAP. This is still players job in the end.
- Made mission intro more Epic and removed (already rather small) chance of a player being hit by tank rounds during start up.
- Made clearer some locations at waypoints for SU-25T in briefing.
- Unified blue coalitions waypoints to enable faster communication, now everyones waypoint 2 is Force and waypoint 4 is outpost.
- Added scripting for players to be notified of their current tasking when entering an aircraft.
- Higher difficulty level can now be enabled by host at any portion of the mission (Host needs to make judgement on whether players are in danger zones.)
- AFAC Predator forced to 'no radar using' not to appear on RWR. DCS bug?
- Fixed edge case where mission could not be completed after insurgent advance was already marked stalled, and troops still got deployed.
- Fixed Predator AFAC speed and alttitude.
- Fixed waypoint speeds for route navigating autopilots (You are still likely to get shot though).
