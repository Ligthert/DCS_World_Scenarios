Situation:

While the tension in South Ossatia keeps rising, it appears our Russian "friends" handed the neighbour of our Georian alies armored vehicles. Its up to use to thin them out without diplimatical incident.

The forces have planted themselves south of Didmukha (MM06), and with the winter landscape they are hard to miss. A JTAC stationed nearby is there to assist two flights of A-10Cs tasked with sufficiently damaging armor.

Notes:
- Due to a shortage in supplies you will fielding whatever we could find in our ammo depots. There will no rearming or changing of loadouts.
- Due to the AAA-threat on the ground, it is required to fly above the clouds (this should be about angels 16). The JTAC needs need to make locating them its first priority.
- Once the two flight reached SP4 and turn towards SP5, contact the on-site JTAC with callsign Playboy6. Playboy6 will guide Ford8 and Uzi9 from there on out
- Ford8 has GBU-38 next to their MK-82 in their loadout. Aim these at the coordinates as the JTAC calls them out.
- There are no relevant threats in the AO other than listed below.
