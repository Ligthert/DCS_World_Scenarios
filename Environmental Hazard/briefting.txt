Situation:
West-Ossetia has an over-representation of Russian hardware and cannot be part of the greater Georgia. Georgia and their allies have setup a taskforce in reducing the power West-Ossatia is able to project on the region.

Unfortunately the budget was slashed due to aggressive money printing by the Fed/ECB, so they are doing thing with little intel and sub-optimal gear.

Mission:

Mission:
Destruction of enemy assets at the Krasnodar Airport.

AO:
The Area of Operation is centered around Krasnodar. Due to the sudden nature of our operations, you will see a lot of civilian air-traffic in the AO. It is less than desirable, however with the power of AWACS and modern imaging technology packed into a TGP it should not be a problem to identify civilian aircrafts from REDFOR.

Enemy:
The enemy will have the following assets on the airfield
- 2 x KA-50
- 4 x Mig-31
- 4 x BTR-80
- 4 x BRDM-2
- 2 x BMP3
- 2 x SA-9 Streal 1 "Gaskin"
- 1 x SA-19 Tunguska "Grison"
- 1 x ZSU-23-4 Shilka "Gun Dish"
- 1 x SA-8 Osa "Gecko"
- X x Su-25T

Some may be active, some not. Take the necessary precautions when engaging.

Assets/Role:
For this mission the following assets are allocated:
- 4 x F-16C - HAVCAP CALLSIGN: Cowboy 1
- 4 x A-10C - AI CALLSIGN: Pig 6
- 1 x E-3A - GOD CALLSIGN: Overlord 5-1

Loadouts are fixed. Rearming is permitted.

Execution:
- All elements will follow the designated flight plan
- Cowboy 1 can fly into the AO at their own discretion, and in conjunction with Overlord 1 start weeding out enemy birds
- Pig 6 is tasked with destroying all assets on the airfield

All flights (but the E-3A) have the same steerpoints.
