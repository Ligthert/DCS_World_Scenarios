Situation:
In recent years the South Ossetians have been ramping up their military rethoric and backed by the Russian powerhouse known as Russia on their northern border they feel emboldend to expand their terrority. And as of now South Ossatian units have moved west and started going into cities and claiming and expanding territory.

As it currently stands Oni and Kashuri are currently under assasult and soldiers are going house-to-house dealing with any opposition and to establish dominance, adding legitemacy to their territorial claims. Both cities have several squads of mechanized infantry, a unit of 1st generation air-defences and a command vehicle. While this isn't much by any modern military standards, this is enough to keep the Georgian army at a safe distance due to their inability to engage without substantial losses.

And this is where we come in. Georgian diplomats have asked us to assist the Georgian military by softening up the hard targets before they move in.

Blue Task:
Hawg1 and Boar2 have the following steerpoints:
1. Fence In
2. IP
3. Clear city (Hawg1: Khashuri; Boar2: Oni )
4. Clear supply stash (Hawg1: Kekhvi; Board2: Didi-Gupta)
5. Exfil
6. Fence Out
7. Finals
8. Land on Vaziani

Steerpoints 3 and 4 have different locations. While Steerpoints 3 are separated by aprox 23nm the difference between steerpoints 4 is less and both flights may need to deconflict the airspace on the tactical net.

While steerpoint 3 speaks for itself (search & destroy), steerpoint 4 is in the middle of enemy territory and it is recommended for both flights to arrive at the same time and start clearing out these two supplies. We suspect that a unit of second generation of air defences is present. So tread with caution.

Frequencies:
Hawg1: 124 MHz AM
Boar2: 125 MHz AM
Tactical: 251 MHz AM
Kutaisi Tower: 134/263 MHz AM
Vaziani Tower: 140/269 MHz AM
